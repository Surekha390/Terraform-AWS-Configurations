data "local_file" "foo" {
  filename = "${path.module}/demo.txt"  #Reads a file from the local filesystem.
}
 # we can see the content of file in .tfstate file
 #${path.module} will get the path from our system where this program exists and then in this path as we mentioned /demo.txt it will be added to the path.
 #instead of giving ${path.module}, we can also give direct path, where this file exists in our local system like: 
#"C:\Users\dci-student\Documents\Surekha-Terraform-Configurations\Terraform-AWS-Configurations\23. Data Sources"
 

 output "my-data" {
    value = data.local_file.foo.content
 }
